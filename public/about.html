<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Sri Abhigna Gottumukkala, but you can call me Abhi. I'm a computer science student with a passion for problem-solving and technology. Currently, I'm diving deep into Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Data Mining, among other subjects in my fourth semester.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I'm actively involved in student organizations like Youth for Seva (YFS) and the Rotaract Club of Gayatri Vidya Parishad, where I contribute to events, including handling certificates for initiatives like blood donation drives.

Designing is my passion and creativity is another side of me—I enjoy working with Canva for designing and have considered launching projects under the name IHBA (a fun reverse of my pen name, Abhi). I like finding the right balance between modern and traditional elements, whether in branding or other aspects of life.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy with coding or organizing events, you'll find me exploring simple Python programs, sharpening my Java skills, or preparing for upcoming exams (which, let's be honest, sometimes come with a bit of last-minute cramming!).Looking forward to new challenges, learning opportunities, and making an impact—one step at a time!</p>
